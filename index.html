    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>
    <p>The video game industry has evolved from a niche hobby into a global economic powerhouse.
      In 2024, the global video game market generated $184.3 billion in revenue (
      <a href="https://app2top.com/news/the-gaming-industry-in-2024-by-the-numbers-a-review-by-gamesindustry-276003.html">
        app2top.com
      </a>
      ) while U.S. consumer spending alone reached $58.7 billion, marking a 106% increase over the
      past decade from $28.4 billion in 2014 (
      <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-consumer-spending-on-video-games-totaled-58-7-billion-in-2024/">
        theesa.com
      </a>
      ). These figures tell the story of an industry that has grown beyond to become a cultural
      force, now standing shoulder-to-shoulder with established entertainment mediums such as film and music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gaming industry is also booming because of its diversity. China and the United States
      together account for over half of global gaming revenue, generating $48.7 billion and
      $47.6 billion, respectively, yet markets like Japan and South Korea are also not far behind
      (<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/video-game-revenue-by-country-2024/">visualcapitalist</a>).
      This industry spans multiple platforms—consoles, PCs, and mobile devices—each with different player 
      behaviors, preferences, and spending patterns. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The video game market spans platforms and genres, appealing to players of all different
      backgrounds and interests. As a major mode of recreation and storytelling, we’re interested
      in understanding what drives success in this dynamic market. With  rapidly evolving trends in
      genres, platforms, and monetization strategies, analyzing historical sales data can reveal
      valuable patterns about what resonates with audiences across different regions and demographics.
      This dataset allows us to explore which games, publishers, and platforms have shaped the industry's
      remarkable trajectory. Through visualizations, we explore trends over time to interpret what
      platforms and publishers are popular over the years. We compare genres, developers, and
      platforms to consider what types of games are successful with a focus on differences in regions.

    <h2>About the Data</h2>
    <p>
      This data was downloaded from 
      <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and
      contains a list of video games with a sales count of greater than 100,000 copies.
      The user who posted the dataset created it by scraping 
      <a href="https://vgchartz.com" target="_blank">vgchartz.com</a>, a video game sales
      tracking website based in the UK.
      The data contains a column attribute called “rank,” corresponding to how the video games are
      ordered on the site by number of sales. It also contains the columns Name, Year, 
      Platform, Genre, Publisher, North American Sales, European Sales, Japan Sales, sales for
      everywhere except those three regions, and Global Sales, which is total worldwide sales.
      Values in each sales column represent sales in millions. The dataset includes video games
      published between 1980 and 2020, inclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original dataset contained 16,598 rows. To reduce the size to better fit the guidelines
      of this project, we preprocessed the data by dropping the rows containing null values and
      filtered the data to contain only video games published between 2000 and 2015, inclusive.
      This reduces our data set to just under 14,000 rows.

    <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
    <h3>Comparing Across Regions</h3>
    <p>
      The structure of the data lends itself to comparison of sales in different regions, and that's
      where we started in order to investigate what might make a game successful, and if that's
      different depending on the targeted region.
    </p>

    <div id="pub-bars">
      <img src="python_visualizations/NA_pub_bars.svg" />
      <img src="python_visualizations/EU_pub_bars.svg" />
      <img src="python_visualizations/JP_pub_bars.svg" />
    </div>
    <p>
      Each of these bar charts shows the top ten publishers by the total number of sales across
      all of their games. We can see that while the top publishers based on sales in North
      America and Europe are very similar, the ranking of Publishers by Japansese sales is
      notably different. Although Nintendo is a top two publisher across all regions, in Japan
      it has displaced Electronic Arts for first place, and has a significantly higher number of
      sales than even the second place publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems there may be a significant difference in sales trends between Japan and 
      North America/Europe, but there are a variety of reasons a certain publisher might be more
      popular than others. Beyond the quality of the games they produce, they may specialize in
      a certain popular genre or publish games for a popular platform.
    </p>

    <div id="genre-bars">
      <iframe src="interactive_visualizations/genre_bars.html"></iframe>
      <p>
        These bar charts depict sales in millions by video game genre. The top bar chart is a
        side-by-side bar chart with the different colored bars representing different market
        regions: Europe, Japan, North America, and all other regions. You can select which
        regions you want dispalyed in this chart by clicking the corresponding colored square
        in the legend. To make more than one selection when clicking on the legend, hold down
        the shift key. The chart below is video game sales by genre, globally. The genres on
        both charts are sorted in descending order by global sales. By default, the charts
        show data for the games released between 2000 and 2015, or you can select which year
        you want to view specifically from the drop down.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this visualization, we can see that North America seems to dominate sales, being the
        region with the most sales for every genre. North America's lead in total sales was 
        visibile in the previous bar graphs, but is clearer here when placed side-by-side with
        other regions instead of relying on reading and remembering the numerical sales counts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genres have a similar ranking by North American and European sales, which follows the same
        trend as Global Sales. By ordering the genres in the upper chart in same way as the bottom
        chart, in decending order by Global Sales, it is made clear which regions follow and inform
        the global trend, and which diverge, especially when toggling different regions on and off.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most genres, North American sales are significantly higher than every other region,
        with the exception of Role-Playing, where Japanese sales are very close in count, indicating
        that Japanase sales in this genre a playing an important role in its global ranking by sales.

    <h3>Comparing Across Platforms</h3>

    <div id="treemap">
      <iframe src="interactive_visualizations/treemap.html"></iframe>
      <p>
        From this treemap, it is evident that Nintendo and Electronic Arts have consistently
        dominated the gaming market over the years, recording total global sales of over 2,360M
        and about 1,992M, respectively. Nintendo’s strongest contribution comes from the Wii, which
        accounts for around 780M in global sales, while Electronic Arts’ leading platform is the
        PS2, contributing about 491M units.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hierarchical nature of this treemap effectively demonstrates how publishers' output is
        comprised, and highights similarities and differences across publishers. For example, some
        publishers are focused on producing content for their own platforms, like Nintendo and
        Microsoft. At the same time, the Wii and PS2 are consistently in the top platforms across
        publishers. This is likely because these were recent consoles from major developers during
        the time range we're looking at (2000-2015), but prompts interesting questions for further
        outside research about what exactly makes a gaming console successful.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="sankey">
      <iframe src="interactive_visualizations/sankey_sales.html"></iframe>
      <p>
        From this Sankey diagram, using a sales threshold of 141M, the Action genre emerges as the dominant
        category, spanning three major platforms — X360, PS3, and PS2 — with cumulative sales
        exceeding 800 M. The Shooter genre follows as the second-highest contributor, concentrated
        primarily on X360 and PS3, with combined sales of 472.9M. In contrast, the Racing genre
        appears more limited in scope, being associated only with the PS2 at this threshold and
        having lower sales. As the sales threshold increases, Shooter, Sports, and Action remain
        the most prominent genres, each maintaining total sales less than 286M but larger than
        271M with the majority of their revenue originating from the North American market. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the threshold is reduced to 46 million units, additional genres — including
        Simulation, Puzzle, Role-Playing, Fighting, and Adventure — become visible. These genres
        demonstrate lower overall sales and are distributed primarily across less-popular or niche
        platforms such as the DS, 3DS, GBA, PSP, Xbox, and Xbox One, while also appearing on more
        widely adopted consoles like the Xbox 360 and Wii. This pattern suggests that while these
        genres attract smaller audiences, they maintain broader platform diversity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This diagram allows for the exploration of the connection between genre and platform
        considered earlier, demonstrating what type of game is driving the popularity of different
        platforms, like sports games for the Wii. The sales threshold slider allows for clear
        overview of how specific genres and platforms dominate at a high level while still allowing
        for the exploration of less popular ones.

        This line chart is used to consider whether the genre popularity we've already explored
        changes over time. Drop down selection allows us to optionally continue to compare across
        regions, and showing/hiding genres by clicking the legend allows for easier legibility
        and focus if desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no clear trend in the release of popular games within specific genres. Each genre,
        across regions and platform families, fluxuates across the years, with no obvious linear
        shape. Spike in the line likely indicate specific games that were particularly successful.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <div id="conclusion">
    <h2>Summary and Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Through these data visualizations it’s clear that video game popularity is shaped by an
      interplay of genre preference, regional differences, platform availability, and publisher
      influence. Blockbuster genres dominate major consoles, niche genres spread across diverse
      platforms, and publisher dominance shifts over time and varies by region. As new players
      enter the market and hardware generations change, what makes a game popular will
      continue to fluctuate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, one of the limits of this dataset is that it’s out of date, focusing on
      games released between 2000 and 2015. For this reason, although we are able to engage
      with differences in categories like market region and genre, publishers and especially
      platforms in this dataset are not current. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, the scope of this project could be expanded by examining current data that
      reflects new consoles like the PS5 or the Nintendo Switch, as well as tying in data about
      console sales to better understand how the success of a platform influences the popularity
      of a game.
